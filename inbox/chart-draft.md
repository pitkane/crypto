### Support and resistance

One of the strongest factors in trading. It takes practice to have the confidence to buy on trend lines but like I mentioned earlier, the best positions can be opened here. Support and resistance exists in all trends. In up or down trends, you should draw lines like I drew above. When a trend line (support/resist line) is broken, support becomes resistance, and resistance becomes support. When the market is moving horizontally, you can still define support and resistance -- it’s just a bit harder to do. Here’s an example from Mind Trader:

## Indicators

is a very powerful indicator and one that is used commonly amongst traders. It shows how much strength is in each price movement.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

### Wedges

Easy to spot. Dunno how

Ascending wedge, eli nousee ylöspäin hiljalleen => Huono merkki. Yleensä vahvat alavaihdot. Varsinkin alhaalta tullut (?).

Descending wedge. Mutta hyvä, yleensä…
Bullish.

### Pull back (50%)

Healthy pull backs are good. Find the level of pull back.
