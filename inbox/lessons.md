### 1. Trend lines

Joining highs and lows to identify

* The trend
* Support and resistance
* Patterns, channels, etc.

Some criteria

* 3 touches along the trendline constitute a valid trendline, 2 touches constitute a tentative one.
* Ideally these touches should be spread out along the trendline and not be clustered together
* Longer lines are more powerful and price will react more forcefully to breaching them
* Usually time frame rules apply i.e. bigger time frames more likely to give valid lines.

How to draw them?

Thus:

* Connecting a high point with another high point
* Extend the line to see if it touches any other points to meet the criteria
* Do the same with lows
* Try to draw to the wicks but this isn't a hard rule
  * Don't skip a nice trendline just because the wick of a fakeout interferes.
* I use the 1h, 4h and 1d to draw my trendlines

Remember:

* Support and resistance are zones, not magic lines
  * Patterns and lines will never be perfect, especially in crypto - don't be lazy, but don't unduly restrict yourself either
* Never 'force' a trendline that you feel should be there but simply doesn't fit
* Keep an eye out for trendlines that were broken

### Lesson 2: Resistance / Support

Written to terminology file.

### Lesson 3: Using the Fibonacci Retracement Tool to Identify Support and Resistance

What I’ve found to work best for me is:

* Anchoring my Fibs at the beginning/end of long trends
* Bigger time frames (for visibility purposes)

Fibs are still powerful and applicable to shorter-term trends. I just have a more conservative trading strategy and have had more success by focusing on longer trends/bigger moves.

#### Finding entries

The Fib retracement tool can be used to identify potential areas where price might retrace to and find support following a move up.

Here's how I setup my Fibs for finding support:

1. First click: bottom of a downtrend
1. Second click: top of an uptrend

Downtrend = consistently lower highs and lower lows

Uptrend = consistently higher highs and higher lows

If you want a more colloquial version: first click is where price bottomed out, and second click is the top that price reached on that move before it started retracing.

### Setting Targets Before ATH

The Fib retracement tool can be used to identify potential areas where price might move up to and find resistance following a move down.

Here’s how I setup my Fibs for finding resistance

1. First click: top of an uptrend
1. Second click: bottom of a downtrend

Downtrend = consistently lower highs and lower lows

Uptrend = consistently higher highs and higher lows

If you want a more colloquial version: first click is the top that price reached on the move before it started retracing, and second click is where price bottomed out

### Setting Targets Before ATH II

Some things to note from the examples:

* Just as every Fib is a potential support zone when drawn from bottom to top, every Fib is a potential resistance zone when drawn from top to bottom.
* The principles are the same, you just flip the starting point to get targets as opposed to supports.
* Once again, these examples show the reliability of using long uptrends and downtrends as your anchor points when setting up Fib levels.

### Setting Targets At/After ATH II

There are two main differences between setting targets before ATH and at/after ATH:

* I personally like anchoring my Fibs around big moves anyway, but when it comes to ATH levels I really recommend anchoring your Fibs on a big move
* The focus will be on Fib extension levels

The differences are minor, as you can tell.

If you want a more colloquial version: anchor your Fibs on the most recent big correction, with click 1 being the top and click 2 being the bottom

### Lesson 4: Mastering RSI

Bearish RSI divergence on ATH has been THE absolute tool in recognizing exhaustion and need of hard correction, I have been studying them since June, and it has been as clear as 20/20 hindsight. Beautiful videos, I would love another one comparing RSI oscillators like stochRSI/ultimate osci/STC and others. Top stuff.

#### Midpoint 50 value crosses

* Indicate whether there's a bullish or bearish bias in the trend
* Indicate whether a trend reversal will happen
* Indicate periods of consolidation
