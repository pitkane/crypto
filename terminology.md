# Terminology

## RSI

Relative Strength Index.

It shows how much strength is in each price movement.

Sometimes the price will move upwards but the RSI indicator won’t move up with it. This is called divergence

## Vol

Volume.
It’s simply how many units were traded during the interval.

* Moving avarage line is usually the last 20 bars by default.
* Volume Trends Confirm Strength
* There are professional traders who use nothing but candles and volume to trade. All indicators are based off of these two indicators.

## BB

Bollinger Bands® are a highly popular technical analysis technique. Many traders believe the closer the prices move to the upper band, the more overbought the market, and the closer the prices move to the lower band, the more oversold the market. John Bollinger has a set of 22 rules to follow when using the bands as a trading system.

## SL

Stop-loss.

## Stoch RSI

Stochastic Oscillator formula to a set of Relative Strength Index (RSI) values

StochRSI = (RSI - Lowest Low RSI) / (Highest High RSI - Lowest Low RSI)

## SMA (MA)

Standard moving averages.

* Used often in daily candles. 50 day maybe? If the price drops below SMA50, fear? Correct to 100SMA? 200 lots of fear.

Break trough -> pull back to MA21, maybe finds good spot to stay? Good momentum to continue

## MACD

* Used mostly on 1D.

## Big Evens

Humans typically like to sell/buy in even numbers. Resistance and Support might end up in even numbers.

* Buy & sell before&after even numbers

## Fibonacci Retracement tool

* * Buy & sell before&after fibonacci segments

## Resistance / Support

The basic premise of this lesson is that resistance can turn to support, and support can turn to resistance.

More specifically, if a support/resistance is adequately breached, then it flips into the opposite role.

An adequately breached support turns into resistance. An adequately breached resistance turns into support.

Adequately breached entails a clean break of the support/resistance with price subsequently trading below the support or above the resistance.

The following graphic shows a this in simple terms - a single line acting both as support (red arrows) and resistance (green arrows)

### Role Reversal - Trend lines

This principle is often seen in trendlines.

If price adequately breaches a support trendline, it becomes resistance. If price adequately breaches a resistance trendline, it becomes support.

This is why I personally like keeping and extending valid trendlines on my charts: to see whether broken trendlines can act as support/resistance in the future (as seen in the forthcoming $BTC example).

Make sure your trendlines are valid, otherwise the market is unlikely to care.

### Role reversal - levels

Support and resistance role reversal is crucial for levels traders.

A level is a horizontal line. Traders try to place their levels in (previous) support and resistance areas that price has reacted to in the past, speculating that price will react to the levels again in the future.

If price adequately breaches a support level, it becomes resistance.

If price adequately breaches a resistance level, it becomes support.

When drawing levels, you should consider (among others): the number of touches on the level, its recency, the violence with which price has reacted to it, and how long it has been active for. The more of each the better i.e. more touches, more recent, more violent reactions by price, and bigger time frames and longer terms are better. The following examples illustrate the point.

### Role Reversal - Patterns

This principle is important when applied to patterns because it may protect a trader from being faked out of a position i.e. where price moves in the expected direction but then stops/reverses.

If a pattern is expected to breakout to the upside, then it is crucial that the pattern’s resistance line is turned from resistance to support (i.e. successfully retest the resistance) in order to confirm the move.

If a pattern is expected to breakout to the downside, then it is a good sign if the pattern’s support line is turned from support into resistance in order to confirm the move.
Note, however, that price within bearish patterns will often just dump out without re-testing the previous support as resistance.

Also note that sometimes price will just breakout and fly without coming back to retest. Waiting for one is more risk averse, but you can miss some real winners too if they just take off.
